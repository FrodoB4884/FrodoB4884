I am Eliot Potts. In my free time I use C# for Unity and GDScript for Godot to make game - none of which have been published. I also use html, css and Javascript from time to time, but I am most proficient in Python. I like to make web scrapers, data processors and occasionally a neural network. I also make UI using the PySimpleGUI library or Tkinter. Other libraries I have experience using are MatPlotLib and NumPy. When I'm making games with Godot or Unity I usually use retro style pixelated art which I make myself using Aseprite.
