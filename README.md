Hi, Iâ€™m @FrodoB4884. I use C#, C++ and various game engines, but mainly I use Python. I like to make web scrapers, data processors and occasionally a neural network. I also make UI using the PySimpleGUI library for my programs in Python. Other libraries I have experience using are MatPlotLib and NumPy. When I'm making games with Godot 4 or Unity I usually use retro style pixelated art which I make myself using Aseprite.
