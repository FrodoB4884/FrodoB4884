Hi there, I am Eliot! 👋

I am a computer science student with a strong passion for exploring and innovating across multiple areas of technology.

In my free time, I enjoy crafting games using C# with Unity 🕹️ and GDScript with Godot 🎮. I have a strong proficiency in Python 🐍, which I use for a variety of projects including:
- Web Scraping 🌐
- Data Processing 📊
- Neural Networks 🤖
- Stock Trading Algorithms 📈
I also dabble in web development using HTML 📄, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript 💻.

Tools and Libraries I use:
Game Development: Unity 🛠️, Godot 🎲
Python GUI: PySimpleGUI 🖥️, Tkinter 🪟
Data Visualization: Matplotlib 📉
Scientific Computing: NumPy 🔢
When creating games, I often opt for a retro, pixelated art style 🎨, which I design myself using Aseprite 🖌️.
