Hi there, I am Eliot! 👋

I am a computer science student with a strong passion for exploring and innovating across multiple areas of technology.

In my free time, I enjoy making games using C# with Unity 🕹️ and GDScript with Godot 🎮. I have a strong proficiency in Python 🐍, which I use for a variety of projects including:
- Web Scraping 🌐
- Data Processing 📊
- Neural Networks 🤖
- Stock Trading Algorithms 📈
I also dabble in web development using HTML 📄, CSS 🎨, and JavaScript 💻.

Tools and Libraries I use:
\nGame Development: Unity, Godot 🎲
\nPython GUI: PySimpleGUI, Tkinter 🖥️
\nData Visualization: Matplotlib 📉
\nScientific Computing: NumPy 🔢
\nWhen creating games, I usually use a retro, pixelated art style and I make my assets myself using Aseprite 👾.
