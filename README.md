Hi there, I am Eliot

I started programming when I was about 10 years old and taught myself, with help from sites like w3schools and CodeAcademy along the way.

In my free time, I enjoy making games using C# with Unity and GDScript with Godot. I have a strong proficiency in Python, which I use for a variety of projects including:
- Web Scraping 
- Data Processing 
- Neural Networks 
- Stock Trading Algorithms 

I also dabble in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Tools and Libraries I use:

- Game Development: Unity, Godot 
- Python GUI: PySimpleGUI, Tkinter 
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib 
- Scientific Computing: NumPy 

When I am creating games, I usually use a retro, pixelated art style and I make my assets myself using Aseprite.
